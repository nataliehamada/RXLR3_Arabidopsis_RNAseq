##Making a text file that contains the % of reads unmapped by STAR per file
awk 'FNR==30 {print FILENAME, $0}' star_align/*/*Log.final.out >2019_AtRXLR3_percentunmapped.txt

##Also something to note -- blasted a few unmapped reads for each sample and a lot of them seem to blast to 16s rRNA genes? Perhaps TAGseq isn't the best at being specific to polyA tail
##Going to simply throw out files with high bacterial contamination -- S8 and S16

#Blasting reads unaligned by STAR to database with lettuce genome + arabidopsis genome
##Seems as if there is either bad contamination or library mix up? Going to blast read files to database containing RXLR3 sequence and also lettuce genome
